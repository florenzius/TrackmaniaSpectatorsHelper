Requirements: Blender 4.0+, Trackmania Club access, Editor++ installed (Openplanet plugin manager)

This plugin exports the positions & rotations of particle system (hair) instances in the proper format that Trackmania (and E++) needs to create Spectator spawn positions.

Once installed in Blender, you can find it in the right menu panel (N) in "Tool". Be aware that it only shows up and works in Object mode, while having an object with particle system selected.

The item file in this repository was provided by [@Xertrov ](https://github.com/XertroV), the creator of E++.

Known issue: Inverted normals will screw sith some positions, so make sure all normals of polygons are facing upwards!
