This plugin exports the positions & rotations of particle system (hair) instances in the proper format that Trackmania (and E++) needs to create Spectator spawn positions.

Once installed in Blender, you can find it in the right menu panel (N) in "Tool". Be aware that it only shows up and works in Object mode, while having an object with particle system selected.
